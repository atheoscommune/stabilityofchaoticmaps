Install R
Install JDK JRE ECLIPSE
Install rJava or individually install the JRI or download the jar files
Go to run configuration and configure the library path under arguments tab VM argument:
 -Djava.library.path="/home/prince/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3/rJava/jri"
 The above path contains JRI otherwise you may give another path to the JRI files
 Under environment tab create a new variabe R_HOME and assign to the location where R is installed eg /usr/lib/R 
 You might have to do the same for each class file you create or jsp etc
 Tomcat might not recognize the above configuration therefore you have to copy the jar files to tomcat/lib folder
